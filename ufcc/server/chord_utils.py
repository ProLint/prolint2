    This function turns residue:contact information into shared contacts. To speed up
    performance, shared contacts are define in an adhoc manner. It takes as input the
    returned dict by `per_lipid_contacts`. It then forms all possible size-2 combinations.

    For a lipid ID, all these residue-residue combinations are seen as shared contacts.
    That is, if a lipid interacts with residues 1, 2, and 3, then all possible size-2
    combination (1-2, 1-3, 2-3) are seen as shared contacts.

    These combinations are assigned as keys, with values corresponding to the sum
    of all matching shared contacts across all lipid IDs. This dict is then returned.
    This approach seems to work quite well in addition to being intuitive. One potential
    disadvantage, however, is that if a residue has very high contact count, then so will
    all combinations involving that residue.

    Another important point to consider is that since shared contacts are defined adhoc,
    an edge linking two nodes, cannot reliably be interpreted as geometric distance.
    Meaning, it does not mean that those two nodes/residues are connected by interactions
    with the same lipid.

    1.
    Is it possible to improve the last point, by counting only real shared contacts?
