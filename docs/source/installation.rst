Installation
============
To install UFCC we highly recommend to create a new conda environment as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n ufcc python=3.7 # it can be any version of python higher than 3.7
   conda activate ufcc

Then you can install UFCC via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ufcc

or conda-forge:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge ufcc
