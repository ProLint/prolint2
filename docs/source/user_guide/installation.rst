Installation
============
Before you can start using **prolint2**, you need to install the software. To ensure a smooth and isolated installation process, we recommend creating a dedicated conda environment. Please follow the steps below:

1. Create a new conda environment:

First, create a new conda environment to encapsulate the installation and usage of **prolint2**. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   conda create -n prolint2 python=3.8

This command sets up a new environment named **prolint2** and specifies Python version 3.8 for compatibility.

2. Activate the conda environment:

You can activate the **prolint2** environment with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   conda activate prolint2

Your command prompt or terminal should now indicate that you are operating within the **prolint2** environment.

3. Install prolint2 via pip:

With the conda environment active, proceed to install prolint2 using the Python package manager, pip:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install prolint2

That's it! You have successfully installed prolint2 within its own dedicated conda environment, providing a controlled and reproducible environment for your lipid-protein interaction analyses.
