Cutoffs are radial, which in our case, has the physical interpretation of $c1 \\subseteq c2$, That is, the contacts with the smaller cutoff are a subset of the contacts with the larger cutoff. This is a very intuitive way of thinking about it, and it allows us to build very complex contact representations with ease, by noting the following: "
