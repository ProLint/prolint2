The **Ultra-Fast Contact Calculation (UFCC)** tool calculates the distance-based contacts between two references using as input the trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations. This release of **ufcc** is done as a concept test covering only the analysis of lipid-protein interactions on the framework of the Canadian Chemistry Conference and Exhibition 2022, but it is thinked to also include other types of interactions in the future (i.e. protein-protein, ligand-protein and ligand-membrane interactions).

Installation
============
To install **ufcc** we highly recommend to create a new conda environment as follows:

``` bash
   conda create -n ufcc python=3.7 (or higher)
   conda activate ufcc
```

Then you can install **ufcc** via pip:

``` bash
   pip install ufcc
```


Basic example:
==============

For serial contacts calculation:

``` python
   from ufcc import UFCC

   target_system = UFCC('coordinates.gro', 'trajectory.xtc') 

   target_system.contacts.compute()
   target_system.contacts.count_contacts()
```
      
For parallel contacts calculation:

``` python
   from ufcc import UFCC

   target_system = UFCC('coordinates.gro', 'trajectory.xtc') 
   target.contacts.runner.backend = 'parallel'
   
   target_system.contacts.compute()
   target_system.contacts.count_contacts()
```

You can find more details on how to use **ufcc** in the [documentation page](https://ufcc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
