The **Ultra-Fast Contact Calculation (UFCC)** tool calculates the distance-based contacts between two references from molecular dynamics simulations. This release of **ufcc** is a *demo* version with a reduced number of features to test how it behaves with different use cases.

Installation
============
To install **ufcc** we recommend creating a new conda environment as follows:

``` bash
   conda create -n ufcc python=3.8 #(or higher)
   conda activate ufcc
```

Then you can install **ufcc** via pip:

``` bash
   pip install ufcc==0.0.7
```

Basic example (from the command-line):
======================================
``` bash 
   ufcc coordinates.gro trajectory.xtc -c 7 
```

The previous line calculates the contacts using a cutoff of 7 Angstroms between all lipids and proteins in the system, and give you a link to launch the visualization dashboard on a browser.

**ufcc** selection interface: 
=============================
You can enter in the interactive selection mode by selecting the `-i` option.

**ufcc** operates on atom selection called groups. **ufcc** defines two refence groups: the *Query* and the *Database*.
**ufcc** calculates contacts between the atoms in the *Query* group and the atoms in the *Database* group at the level of residue. By default, **ufcc** will extract proteins into the *Query* groups, and lipids into the *Database* group (if your membrane has lipids with resnames different to those recognized by default by **ufcc** [POPC, DPPC, DOPC, CHOL, CHL1, POPS, POPE] you can add them using the `-al` option). The current interface allows you to customize these selections based on your needs. We have created a few default selections and user-friendly actions that you can perform on them to reach a high level of especificity in the selections. Note that when you have created a group with the especific selection that you need, you can update either the *Database* or *Query* groups, as follow:
``` 
db Group_ID
```
or
```
qr Group_ID
```

You can see a detailed  list of the action keys below:
``` 
db  :  update database group for contacts calculation. (i.e. >> db Group_ID) where Group_ID is the identifier of the group on the list of groups.
qr  :  update query group for contacts calculation. (i.e. >> qr Group_ID) where Group_ID is the identifier of the group on the list of groups.
gb :  create subgroups grouped by any topology attribute ("names", "resnames", "masses", etc). (i.e. >> gp Group_ID resnames) creates new groups for every different resname in the Group_ID selected.
sl  :  create new groups by splitting a previous group at the desired level ("segment", "residue", "atom", "molecule"). (i.e. >> sl Group_ID residue) splits the Group_ID selected into all the residues that make it up, and create a new group for each of them.
add:  merge two or more groups and create a new group with the combination. (i.e. >> add Group_ID1 Group_ID2 ... Group_IDn) creates a new group for the combination of the groups Group_ID1 Group_ID2 ... Group_IDn.
del:  delete a group from the list of groups. (i.e. >> del Group_ID) remove the Group_ID selected.
lg :  print the list of groups.
h  :  print the help for all the available action keys.
e  :  exit interactive selection and calculate de contacts between the Query and Database groups. 
```
As for explaining the capabilities of this selection interface we will show some examples below using a membrane made up POPS, CHOL and POPE and a single protein:

**Example 1:** Using only two types of protein residues (ARG and LEU) as *Query* and all the lipids in the membrane as *Database*:
